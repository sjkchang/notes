The process of extracting interesting patterns or knowledge from data.

Domain knowledge is critical for going from good results to great results. Applying data mining effectively usually requires insights from domain-specific knowledge to be integrated with the algorithms

### Steps to Data Mining
1.  Data Cleaning
2. Data Integration
3. Data Selection
4. Data Transformation
5. Data Mining
6. Pattern Evaluation
7. Knowledge Representation

The various [[Data Mining Methodologies]] follow these steps, though various methodologies combine and rename some steps.
### Synonyms
- Knowledge discovery in databases
- knowledge extraction
- data/pattern analysis
- data archeology
- data dredging (negative)
- information harvesting
- business intelligence

Similar to Data Analytics, however data mining is scaleable, more usable and has better implementation
