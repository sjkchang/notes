Would need support from large, high demand tech company like FAANG companies

Create Graph based system similar to obsidians notes where every piece of technical experience you have ever developed can be shared. Two types of nodes, skills or tech experience

each skill node can be linked to a number of experiences. Description of experience, GitHub links, ect.

Provide tooling that parses through github to determine project/skills used and generate a graph that can be built off of, or reviewed and submitted

Provide tooling that company can provide job technical requirements, and applicant can see requirements and add to their graph if they have those experiences just undocumented

Each requirement can have a trust score. How likely is it that this person actually has this skill. Ex. GitHub profile doesn't have many contributions on project they said they gained skills from. 

Core Value: Transparency. Applicants should know why they got rejected. So they can improve there graph for the future. 

Skills Nodes can have two values. Self reported proficiency and system guessed proficiency. Guessed proficiency should

Anything listed as technical skill can be tested. 

On Applicant side, can take in job description and graph to generate a traditional resume

Concern: lead to increased qualified applicant load as current ATS systems eliminate alot of people because of lack of transparency.
