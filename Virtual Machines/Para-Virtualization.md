-  A technique to improve performance of virtualization
-  The guest OS is modified to be hypervisor aware  
-  Hypervisor provides paravirtual device drivers and APIs  
-  Guest OS uses these instead of emulated devices  
- The hypervisor presents a paravirtual interface  
- Special calls replace hardware instructions  
- For example, hypercalls instead of SYSCALL  
- Guest uses hypercall for CPU mode transitions  
- Avoids traps and emulation overhead
