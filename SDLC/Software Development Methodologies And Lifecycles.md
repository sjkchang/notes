### Software Development Lifecycles

- A framework that defines the steps or phases of building high quality software
- It provides a structure for managing complex software processes and improving code quality 
- There are various models and philosophies for different projects

#### Types of Modes
- Waterfall
	- Linear Sequential approach
	- Requirements, Design, Implementation, verification, maintenance
	- Advantage
		- Simple and easy
		- Clear and stable requirements
		- Rigorous testing and docs
	- Disadvantage
		- No customer feedback
		- Difficult to accommodate changes
	- Example: NASA Space Shuttle
		- Strict Sequential process
		- Ensure safety and reliability of software system
		- Cost 10 Billion and ten years to develop
- Agile
	- Focus on collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvements
	- Consists of short _"Sprints"_ of planning, designing, implementing and testing
	- Working software built incrementally from start to finish
	- Advantage
		- Allow Feedback and customer involvement
		- Allows for changing requirements
		- Delivers working software quickly and frequently
	- Disadvantage 
		- Requires high level of communication
		- May lack documentation and structure
		- Scope Creep
	- Examples:
		- SCRUM
			- Self organizing teams
			- Fixed length sprints based on priority
			- Daily standups, sprint reviews, retrospectives
			- Roles: Product owner, scrum master, team
			- Advantages
				- Increase productivity, stakeholder engagement
			- Disadvantages
				- Requires Proper Agile Software Development skills
					- ex. Knowing how to break down tasks
		- KANBAN
			- Visualize workflow on Kanban board with columns
			- Pull bases system, work is pulled into progress
			- Focus on just-in-time delivery, work in progress limits
			- Continuous flow
			- Advantages
				- Flexible, visual tracking, continuous delivery
			- Disadvantages
				- Needs active participation from all team members
		- Spiral Models
			- Risk Driven approach to software development
			- 4 Quadrants: Planning, risk analysis, engineering and evaluation
			- Advantages
				- Allows feedback and customer involvement
				- Adapts to changing requirements
			- Disadvantages
				- Requires risk analysis experts
				- High level of management
				- Complex and costly
				- Excessive documentation
- V-model
- spiral
- XP
- Kanban
- Iterative & Incremental Model
	- Cyclical Approach to software development
	- Consists of repeated cycles of planning, designing, implementing and testing
	- Each iteration is a mini waterfall
	- Advantage
		- Allows feedback
		- Accommodates changes and errors
		- Delivers software quickly
	- Disadvantages
		- No clear endpoint
		- Requires more resources and management
	- Examples: 
		- Iterative & Incremental
		- RUP

Sequential -> Evolutionary
Formal -> Informal
